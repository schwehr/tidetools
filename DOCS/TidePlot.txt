tidePlot

The program tidePlot takes files of the timestamp height format, as generated by tideConvert, tideTrim, tideFilter, and tideDownsample and plots them with time on the horizontal axis.
[edit] The Tools

    tideConvert - to generate water level in a standard format from recorded data
    tidePlot - to visually check the result and see any significant data gaps
    tideTrim - to remove outliers
    tideFilter - to smooth the data
    tidePeaks - analysis for offsets and scale
    tideResample - interpolates and downsamples (under development and testing) 

[edit] Algorithm

There is no algorithm. This program merely forwards the data to the plotting matplotlib plotting tool.

[edit] Manipulating and Saving Plots
A sample display from tidePlot showing a raw data set compared to a filtered one

The Python library used to display the data is similar to that of Matlab's. You can zoom and pan and save the image a file. See matplotlib for details.
